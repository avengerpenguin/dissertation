# Lift Pitch

I want to explore data mining techniques on BBC or other media web content. This
applies the research to real world data with two obvious challenges: content
and its metadata are published over time (i.e. we don't have all the content
up front) and I intend to extract content metadata in the form of RDF graphs.

Semantic web and linked data research and applied tools make the extraction
simpler, but I would also like to explore how I might exploit those techniques further
to enrich the data ahead of applying machine learning. There may be scope to complement
the semantic web exctaction with natural language extraction too.

A deliverable and demoable outcome of this might be a single-page content
"home page" that visualises machine learning insights (e.g. content ordered into
clusters) and provides a usable web product where users benefit from exploring
the content via the models produced, e.g. viewing content grouped by cluster.
